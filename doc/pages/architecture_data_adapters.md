# Data Adapters
This diagram shows one of our connected machines, a HAAS 5-axis equipped with an MTConnect module. An edge device sits on the network alongside the machine and hosts our data adapter. The data adapter collects MTConnect data from the machine and converts it into an MQTT payload to publish to our MQTT Broker.
