# Data Adapters
The data adapters, are a library of adapters meant to stream data to the MQTT broker. It's purpose is to translate data from it's original state to MQTT payload.  The data adapters are created by CMU and are all open-source. 

In the example, the data adapter collects MTConnect data from the machine and converts it into an MQTT payload to publish to our MQTT Broker.
